## About Me

I am a third year PhD student in the Human Genetics program. I do research on the epigenetics of pancreatic cancer in Andy Feinberg's lab. As a wet lab researcher, I only know the basics of coding in R and statistics, but I'm looking forward to learning more!

2.  I do aerial arts (like you can see in cirque du soleil!)

3.  I love to bake, especially chocolate chip cookies

4.  I have a dog named Darwin after Charles Darwin
